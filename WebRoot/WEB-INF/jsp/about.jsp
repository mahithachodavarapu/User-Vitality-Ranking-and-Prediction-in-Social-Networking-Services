                </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Social networking services have been prevalent at many online communities such as Twitter.com and Weibo.com, where
millions of users keep interacting with each other every day. One interesting and important problem in the social networking services
is to rank users based on their vitality in a timely fashion. An accurate ranking list of user vitality could benefit many parties in social
network services such as the ads providers and site operators. Although it is very promising to obtain a vitality-based ranking list of
users, there are many technical challenges due to the large scale and dynamics of social networking data. In this paper, we propose a
unique perspective to achieve this goal, which is quantifying user vitality by analyzing the dynamic interactions among users on social
networks. Examples of social network include but are not limited to social networks in microblog sites and academical collaboration
networks. Intuitively, if a user has many interactions with his friends within a time period and most of his friends do not have many
interactions with their friends simultaneously, it is very likely that this user has high vitality. Based on this idea, we develop quantitative
measurements for user vitality and propose our first algorithm for ranking users based vitality. Also we further consider the mutual
influence between users while computing the vitality measurements and propose the second ranking algorithm, which computes user
vitality in an iterative way. Other than user vitality ranking, we also introduce a vitality prediction problem, which is also of great
importance for many applications in social networking services. Along this line, we develop a customized prediction model to solve
the vitality prediction problem. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we collect two dynamic social network data sets. The
experimental results with both data sets clearly demonstrate the advantage of our ranking and prediction methods.
